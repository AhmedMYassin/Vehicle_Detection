**Vehicle Detection Project**

In Vehicle Detection Project, it's expected to be able to detect vehicle in images and apply this detection algorithm to videos to track vehicles.
To detect vehicles in images, I needed to perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a Linear support vector machine classifier

* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

You're reading it!

###Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

####1. In IPython notebook, I start with getting my training data ""Kitti dataset for vehicle and non-vehicle images".  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

###2. 
I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

####2. After I tried different parameters for the HOG feature extraction I used these parameters for processing the data:


####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using...

###Sliding Window Search

####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

####2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

####1. Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


####2. To filter the flase positives, I used the positive detections in batches of concecutive frames to create a heatmap which was thresholded to get rid of all false positives.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video.

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?
The proposed pipeline didn't use the color histogram as it caused many false positives, maybe my training data isn't enough or that
